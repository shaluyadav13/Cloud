My videos page - <title> </title> is be overrided in C# somewhere to give a new title of "myVideos".

I chose "Myraid Pro" for the font of the site and the back up font is "Arial" if you feel you would like 
to change this in the future go for it.



Login Page - Done

My videos - Sort function does not work, if I had more time I would like to add a grid view / list
view.  In the future this page could be called My Files and upon login you would see all
of your files including audio / web projets. The icon in the explorer bar would be a folder
with text "My Files". Everytime you would click on a file and go deeper into your files a
icon would be added in the file explorer bar with text saying the tile of that item.

Groups - File explorer needs to be finished.  When you are in a group you should have an icon
that shows what group you are in next to the My Groups Icon.


Upload - Done

Help - The image for the << and >> could stand to be redesigned. Also this help page is from
the old site/design so the text may be inaccurate, the entire help section needs to be proof 
read and tested, such as to make sure all the links go to the correct place as things may 
have changed.

Admin - Editing student groups sometimes displays
the "Current students" with 0 width showing no names, reason unknown.




ID's for faculty to seperate them from admins / the design and what they see and how they see it
needs to be done.


James I put an image for the default thumbnail image in the images folder as well as a File being converted
image.
